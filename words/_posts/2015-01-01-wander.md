I've spent the last twelve months discovering interesting subjects, traveling, meeting new people and preparing for the road ahead.

As I just left my previous job, January started roaring with a 2 weeks programming contract in San Francisco. There I discovered what [great](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/) [coffee](https://www.ritualroasters.com/) is and enjoyed the diversity provided by the food trucks, bike messenger culture and the city's overall forward thinking vibe. I also had the opportunity to visit both [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ca) and [Github](https://github.com/) offices.

Spring brought me to experience a 10 days Vipassana retreat, which I've described in [this article](/words/vipassana-one-breadth-at-a-time.html). Challenged by a friend, I also tried to eat glutten-free for one week and I am forced to admit it has been quite hard to resist. I've also freelanced for [Watershed Monitoring](http://watershedmonitoring.com/) and had a blast learning about water management.

Lots of things intertwined during summer. I've road-tripped with some friends to Cap Hateras, North Carolina and had a great time. Then, back home I've learned how to butcher a lamb in order to feed a family. An abnormally generous barista from [Café St-Henry](http://www.sainthenri.ca/) in Montreal gave my friend and I a fine coffee making lesson. That night I tasted 21 epressos. I've completed [Stanford's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course tought by [Andrew Ng](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg) on Coursera and opened my mind to a new paradigm. The [Musée de la Civilisation](https://www.mcq.org) hired me for a few weeks. I used my spare time to explore the underground workshops of the museum.

As autumn arrived slowly, I enjoyed documenting a videoclip's "behind the scenes" produced by my friends at [La Raffinerie](http://www.laraffinerie.co/). I also had the opportunity to cook a whole lamb in an open pit to feed 30+ people for a friend's birthday. After sailing with a team all summer long, I've competed for the last race of the season in [Cap-à-l'Aigle](https://goo.gl/maps/2EVRCun7nF42). By the end of september I was stumbling through the organisation of my imminent departure for India. I wrote about these 2.5 months of adventure [right here](/words/linde.html). Finally, 2014 ended in St-Augustine, Florida with some good friends in yet another road-trip.

I intended to start volunteering and learn a new programming language but I refrained to make it happen as a mix of fear and lack of prioritization.

I've really enjoyed wandering but now I feel it's time to settle. Let's see what 2015 has to offer.
