This is a story about soaring into the sky, falling, crashing, putting yourself back together, and trying to fly again.

### 2015

That year I went from partner to employee, from teammate to solo, and from friend to enemy.

Early in January, I joined a small startup as the first employee, with open intentions of becoming a partner soon after. In just a few months the team grew from 3 to 10 people, the company moved from one of the cofounder's house basement to an office, and business exploded. We were first-time entrepreneurs, moving fast and figuring out most things as they came. I must admit to this day it's been the most thrilling year of my life. I've learned a lot, gained confidence and valuable experience.

Unfortunately, by the end of the year, it was clear I wouldn't become a partner in the company. It was my hope from the beginning, and I took the hit very hard. I thought I had finally found a project I could contribute to that would become bigger than me, and where everyone had plenty of room to grow. I learned the hard way you can't be the biological father of a child you haven't conceived.

Incomprehension, deception, and broken hopes were weighing heavy on me. I took the resolution not to feed my anger and resentment, trying not to become a shadow of myself living in an alternate reality where things would have been different. Easier said than done.

### 2016

In march, I was finally ready for a new adventure. Hardened by the recent war story, I was careful not to repeat the same mistakes. I still had the fire, and explored a few ideas but I couldn't find anything that would be viable within my constraints.

Then, Facebook released the messenger platform at [F8](https://www.fbf8.com/) and the bot storm took the world. It had the effect of a bomb - creating new paradigms and opening appealing opportunities. A shift was suddenly in motion and either you jumped or you watched it happen. I started [Dialog Analytics](https://dialoganalytics.com/) during these times of disruption and turmoil.

I thought I knew how the startup game worked by watching it from afar for a long time, but doing it for real is something else. I've spent most of the year validating the market, building the product, and talking to users.

#### Adventures

Here are some adventures that happened while building Dialog:

- Rode the 12 hours [Adirondack train](https://www.amtrak.com/adirondack-train) to New-York twice to meet with [Betaworks](https://betaworks.com/) for their [botcamp](https://betaworks.com/botcamp/) program and to attend a bot meetup. Unfortunately, Dialog was not selected for botcamp but I learned a lot by being under the intense pressure of pitching a then vague idea.

- Spent a month in Palo Alto and San Francisco to talk with potential users and feel the valley vibe. I've drunk enough [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/) and [Philz Coffee](https://www.philzcoffee.com/) for a lifetime.

- Met with a Googler at the [Googleplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex) to talk bots.

- Hiked in the beautiful [Big Basin Redwoods State Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=540) with my brother.

- Attended Salesforce's [Dreamforce](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF16/), and was blown away by the sheer size of the event.

- Connected with many entrepreneurs from Quebec, Montreal, Austin, Tel Aviv, Berlin and San Francisco.


#### Dialog

At the moment the product is still in beta, with a few customers using it daily. I've built SDKs for [Node](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/dialog-node) and [Ruby](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/dialog-ruby), integration examples for [Facebook Messenger](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/messenger-ruby-example), [Telegram](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/telegram-ruby-example), [Twilio SMS](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/twilio-sms-ruby-example), [Kik](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/kik-node-example), [Botkit](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/botkit-messenger-example) as well as [Botpress](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-example). I also released a 1-click [integration](https://dialoganalytics.com/smooch/) for [Smooch](https://smooch.io), allowing clients to install Dialog without coding skills.

Despite what it seems, building a [SAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) business is incredibly hard. Being a solo founder with a bootstrapped business just adds more difficulty. I've adopted proven strategies to tackle these challenges:

- **Frugality:** Keeping expenses low is a tremendous advantage that gives you a lot of flexibility.
- **Product focus:** Building something people want is the single most important thing.
- **Talking to users:** It's time-consuming, but it's also a necessity that will spare you a lot of efforts going in the wrong direction.

The next steps are iterating towards product/market fit, determining a pricing model and coming out of beta. Fun times ahead :)
