### Getting started

This repo uses:

- Ruby/Jekyll for the site
- `pnpm` for frontend dependencies

Install dependencies:

`pnpm install`

`bundle install`

Run the site locally:

`bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`

### Deploy

Deployed with [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)

Netlify will use `pnpm` automatically when `pnpm-lock.yaml` is present.
