### Getting started

This repo uses:

- [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) for the site
- `pnpm` for dependencies
- `sass` to compile `css/styles.scss` to `_site/css/styles.css`

Install dependencies:

`pnpm install`

Run the site locally:

`pnpm run dev`

Build the site:

`pnpm run build`

### Deploy

Deployed with [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)

Netlify will use `pnpm` automatically when `pnpm-lock.yaml` is present.
